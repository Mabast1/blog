#### Why Beach? 

Sometimes I just need to slow down and catch my breath. I need to let go of all the stress that has slowly built 
and built inside me, day after tedious day. Luckily, I can fix whatever ails me and bring myself back just by 
closing my eyes and lying on some sand. The beach is escapism in all itâ€™s forms: contemplative, thrill seeking, fun.

#### Why Night? 

Night times out on the beach needs to be spend with people who has same desires to life like you do. Thats why when I go 
I invite the friends that I am most comfortable with, that I can share my thoughts with, and finally to exchange some awesome
and adventurous moments with them. 

The Night Sun: On clear day and full moon, you can see the horizon and lots of stars with moonlight reflection in the water.
To me, this is my favorite thing about night beach. "Peaceful sound" No one is talking around you. 
I like to sit down on the beach and just listen to the wave. The sound the ocean and the breeze really put my mind at peace.
