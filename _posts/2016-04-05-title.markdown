#### Biology in the Computer Age 
Biology is defined as the study of living things. In the course of that study, biologists collect and interpret data. Now, at the beginning of the 21st century, we use sophisticated laboratory technology that allows us to collect data faster than we can interpret it.

*Bioinformatics* is the science of using information to understand biology,Unfortunately, with all the hype about mapping the human genome, bioinformatics has achieved buzzword status; the term is being used in a number of ways, depending on who is using it. Strictly speaking, bioinformatics is a subset of the larger field of computational biology , the application of quantitative analytical techniques in modeling biological systems.

The field of bioinformatics relies heavily on work by experts in statistical methods and pattern recognition. Researchers come to bioinformatics from many fields, including mathematics, computer science, and linguistics.   
bioinformatics makes it possible to do exciting things such as compare DNA sequences and generate results that are potentially significant. "Potentially significant" is perhaps the most important phrase.

#### The Eye of the Fly 
Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster ) are a popular model system for the study of development of animals from embryo to adult. Fruit flies have a gene called eyeless, which results in fruit flies with no eyes. It's obvious that the eyeless gene plays a role in eye development.

Researchers have identified a human gene responsible for a condition called aniridia. In humans who are missing this gene (or in whom the gene has mutated just enough for its protein product to stop functioning properly), the eyes develop without irises.


If the gene for aniridia is inserted into an eyeless drosophila, it causes the production of normal drosophila eyes. It's an interesting coincidence. Could there be some similarity in how eyeless and aniridia function, even though flies and humans are vastly different organisms? Possibly. To gain insight into how eyeless and aniridia work together, we can compare their sequences. Always bear in mind, however, that genes have complex effects on one another. Careful experimentation is required to get a more definitive answer.

As little as 15 years ago, looking for similarities between eyeless and aniridia DNA sequences would have been like looking for a needle in a haystack.
But these days, a biologist can find dozens of sequence matches in seconds using sequence-alignment programs such as BLAST and FASTA. 

The Figure below shows a standard form for submitting data to NCBI for a BLAST search:
